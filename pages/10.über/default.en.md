# About this site

This site is an unofficial demo site for [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org) by [Crabston GmbH](https://crabston.ch). It contains tutorials and guides to help you manage and maintain your Grav website.

## Notes

1. These guides are only for managing an existing website with Grav, not for installing Grav itself or creating a new website. For that, refer to the [official Grav documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org).
2. Depending on the configuration of your website (plugins, themes, etc.), it is possible that it does not have the same features and options as described in the guides.
3. Please read the guides carefully and test your changes on a test environment or in a private area before applying them to your live website.
4. Since these guides were created for Crabston GmbH customers, some guides may be specific to these websites as they contain their own configurations that your website may not have. However, you are still allowed to use and share these guides.
5. Although the guides are carefully created and based on the latest information, they may no longer be up to date or may not work anymore. We strive to review and update the guides regularly, but cannot guarantee their accuracy and functionality.

## Contact

If you have any questions or suggestions about the guides or this site, feel free to contact us. We appreciate your feedback and are happy to help. You can find our contact details on the [contact page (German)](https://crabston.ch/über/kontakt).

If you have technical issues with your website that cannot be solved by the guides, please contact your webmaster or contact us via [support@crabston.dev](mailto:support@crabston.dev) (only for Crabston GmbH customers with a support contract or for a fee).
